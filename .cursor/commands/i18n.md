I want to make a {1} version of the docs. Make -{2} versions of each thing, appropriate meta tags, and add with the other languages in all the places. In AGENTS.md we need to add instructions that for now on any new changesets, public documentation, and public JSDOC comments should include a minimal {1} translation below the English. Any time those files are updated in English, we need to do the corresponding update in the {1} version.

Perform research to identify the most well-known dialect of {1}, preferred formality and tone, and utilize it for the translation. Lastly, I'd like you to look at some popular {1}-language open source developer sites and see if they do anything unique that is not common in the American tech scene. For instance, a particular style of writing or didactic style.

Work on each file individually as its own TODO.
