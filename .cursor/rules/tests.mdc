- Test assertions may only have a single possible result.
- Test assertions should cover both the content and shape of the result.
- Renderer suites should focus exclusively on renderer behavior, with the parser suite handling common parsing scenarios.
- 80% or greater cumulative coverage is required.
- Tests should always assert a specific result shape, generic existence checks like `toBeTruthy()` or `toBeDefined()` are not allowed.
- Add tests to existing test files rather than creating new ones.
