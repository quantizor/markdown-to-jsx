- Optimize new rules for token efficiency: no bold/emphasis, headers, and stylistic formatting, concise/compact and highly-specific language
- Remove examples unless critical for understanding
- Prefer abbreviations and acronyms when unambiguous
- Use minimal punctuation, only where necessary for clarity
- Remove meta-commentary about the rule itself
- Focus on actionable directives, not explanations
- `.cursor/rules` = best practices, `AGENTS.md` = repository-specific directives
