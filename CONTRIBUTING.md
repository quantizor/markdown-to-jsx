# Contributing to markdown-to-jsx

First, welcome and thanks so much for your interest in helping to make this library the best it can be!

markdown-to-jsx v9 is a ground-up rewrite of the library to enable highest performance and 100% GFM+CommonMark specification compliance. Here are some general guidelines of what this library looks to solve:

- Smallest possible bundle size (a challenge given the complexity of the spec)
- Highly configurable
- Support rendering arbitrary HTML in markdown

## Writing a PR

A good pull request should include a description of the change, any relevant links (security advisories, reproduction sandbox, github issue), and at least one test. We're not aiming for 100% coverage, but try to add tests for the various angles that your code might be hit from including unhappy paths.

## Cutting a release

This is handled automatically via changesets.

## Code of Conduct

markdown-to-jsx is maintained by a diverse team and seeks to maintain a healthy, inclusive environment for contributors. Any slurs, hate speech, or other aggressions of that nature will not be tolerated and the relevant parties will be blocked from the repository. Zero exceptions, be professional.

Finally, please realize that this library is maintained by community volunteers. We are not compensated for our time and entitlement behavior will not be tolerated. You won't be blocked for acting this way, but don't expect a response.
