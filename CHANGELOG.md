## 7.4.5

### Patch Changes

- f5a0079: fix: double newline between consecutive blockquote syntax creates separate blockquotes

  Previously, for consecutive blockquotes they were rendered as one:

  **Input**

  ```md
  > Block A.1
  > Block A.2

  > Block B.1
  ```

  **Output**

  ```html
  <blockquote>
    <p>Block A.1</p>
    <p>Block A.2</p>
    <p>Block.B.1</p>
  </blockquote>
  ```

  This is not compliant with the [GFM spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/#block-quotes) which states that consecutive blocks should be created if there is a blank line between them.
