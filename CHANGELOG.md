# markdown-to-jsx

## 7.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 62a16f3: Allow modifying HTML attribute sanitization when `options.sanitizer` is passed by the composer.

  By default a lightweight URL sanitizer function is provided to avoid common attack vectors that might be placed into the `href` of an anchor tag, for example. The sanitizer receives the input, the HTML tag being targeted, and the attribute name. The original function is available as a library export called `sanitizer`.

  This can be overridden and replaced with a custom sanitizer if desired via `options.sanitizer`:

  ```jsx
  // sanitizer in this situation would receive:
  // ('javascript:alert("foo")', 'a', 'href')

  ;<Markdown options={{ sanitizer: (value, tag, attribute) => value }}>
    {`[foo](javascript:alert("foo"))`}
  </Markdown>

  // or

  compiler('[foo](javascript:alert("foo"))', {
    sanitizer: (value, tag, attribute) => value,
  })
  ```

## 7.4.7

### Patch Changes

- 7603248: Fix parsing isolation of individual table cells.
- f9328cc: Improved block html detection regex to handle certain edge cases that cause extreme slowness. Thank you @devbrains-com for the basis for this fix ü§ù

## 7.4.6

### Patch Changes

- a9e5276: Browsers assign element with `id` to the global scope using the value as the variable name. E.g.: `<h1 id="analytics">` can be referenced via `window.analytics`.
  This can be a problem when a name conflict happens. For instance, pages that expect `analytics.push()` to be a function will stop working if the an element with an `id` of `analytics` exists in the page.

  In this change, we export the `slugify` function so that users can easily augment it.
  This can be used to avoid variable name conflicts by giving the element a different `id`.

  ```js
  import { slugify } from 'markdown-to-jsx';

  options={{
    slugify: str => {
      let result = slugify(str)

      return result ? '-' + str : result;
    }
  }}
  ```

## 7.4.5

### Patch Changes

- f5a0079: fix: double newline between consecutive blockquote syntax creates separate blockquotes

  Previously, for consecutive blockquotes they were rendered as one:

  **Input**

  ```md
  > Block A.1
  > Block A.2

  > Block B.1
  ```

  **Output**

  ```html
  <blockquote>
    <p>Block A.1</p>
    <p>Block A.2</p>
    <p>Block.B.1</p>
  </blockquote>
  ```

  This is not compliant with the [GFM spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/#block-quotes) which states that consecutive blocks should be created if there is a blank line between them.
