'markdown-to-jsx': patch
---

Add Hindi (हिन्दी) language support for internationalization. Includes full translations of documentation (README, markdown spec, GFM spec, interactive demo template), UI strings, and JSDoc translations for all public APIs using the `@lang hi` tag. Hindi is now the third supported language after English and Mandarin Chinese, following global speaker rankings (Ethnologue 2025).
