- This project uses bun package manager.
- When debugging, you can directly import index.tsx if using the bun CLI without needing a build step to run experimental scripts.
- All scripts can be written in TypeScript since Bun handles it natively.
- Use `bun run test` to run the tests.
- NEVER UPDATE TEST SNAPSHOTS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.
- When running experiments, use bun cli to run a script instead of node because it can handle importing typescript files directly without needing to build the library first.
- When you run CLI benchmarking and tests do not use `tail` to limit the output.
