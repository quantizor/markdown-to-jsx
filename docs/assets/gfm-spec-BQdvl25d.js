All the features which are supported in\nGitHub user content and that are not specified on the original CommonMark Spec\nare hence known as **extensions**, and highlighted as such.\n\nWhile GFM supports a wide range of inputs, it\'s worth noting that GitHub.com\nand GitHub Enterprise perform additional post-processing and sanitization after\nGFM is converted to HTML to ensure security and consistency of the website.\n\n## What is Markdown?\n\nMarkdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents,\nbased on conventions for indicating formatting in email\nand usenet posts.  It was developed by John Gruber (with\nhelp from Aaron Swartz) and released in 2004 in the form of a\n[syntax description](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\nand a Perl script (`Markdown.pl`) for converting Markdown to\nHTML.  In the next decade, dozens of implementations were\ndeveloped in many languages.  Some extended the original\nMarkdown syntax with conventions for footnotes, tables, and\nother document elements.  Some allowed Markdown documents to be\nrendered in formats other than HTML.  Websites like Reddit,\nStackOverflow, and GitHub had millions of people using Markdown.\nAnd Markdown started to be used beyond the web, to author books,\narticles, slide shows, letters, and lecture notes.\n\nWhat distinguishes Markdown from many other lightweight markup\nsyntaxes, which are often easier to write, is its readability.\nAs Gruber writes:\n\n> The overriding design goal for Markdown\'s formatting syntax is\n> to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a\n> Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as\n> plain text, without looking like it\'s been marked up with tags\n> or formatting instructions.\n> (<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>)\n\nThe point can be illustrated by comparing a sample of\n[AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) with\nan equivalent sample of Markdown.  Here is a sample of\nAsciiDoc from the AsciiDoc manual:\n\n```\n1. List item one.\n+\nList item one continued with a second paragraph followed by an\nIndented block.\n+\n.................\n$ ls *.sh\n$ mv *.sh ~/tmp\n.................\n+\nList item continued with a third paragraph.\n\n2. List item two continued with an open block.\n+\n--\nThis paragraph is part of the preceding list item.\n\na. This list is nested and does not require explicit item\ncontinuation.\n+\nThis paragraph is part of the preceding list item.\n\nb. List item b.\n\nThis paragraph belongs to item two of the outer list.\n--\n```\n\nAnd here is the equivalent in Markdown:\n```\n1.  List item one.\n\n    List item one continued with a second paragraph followed by an\n    Indented block.\n\n        $ ls *.sh\n        $ mv *.sh ~/tmp\n\n    List item continued with a third paragraph.\n\n2.  List item two continued with an open block.\n\n    This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.\n\n    1. This list is nested and does not require explicit item continuation.\n\n       This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.\n\n    2. List item b.\n\n    This paragraph belongs to item two of the outer list.\n```\n\nThe AsciiDoc version is, arguably, easier to write. You don\'t need\nto worry about indentation.  But the Markdown version is much easier\nto read.  The nesting of list items is apparent to the eye in the\nsource, not just in the processed document.\n\n## Why is a spec needed?\n\nJohn Gruber\'s [canonical description of Markdown\'s\nsyntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)\ndoes not specify the syntax unambiguously.  Here are some examples of\nquestions it does not answer:\n\n1.  How much indentation is needed for a sublist?  The spec says that\n    continuation paragraphs need to be indented four spaces, but is\n    not fully explicit about sublists.  It is natural to think that\n    they, too, must be indented four spaces, but `Markdown.pl` does\n    not require that.  This is hardly a "corner case," and divergences\n    between implementations on this issue often lead to surprises for\n    users in real documents. (See [this comment by John\n    Gruber](https://web.archive.org/web/20170611172104/http://article.gmane.org/gmane.text.markdown.general/1997).)\n\n2.  Is a blank line needed before a block quote or heading?\n    Most implementations do not require the blank line.  However,\n    this can lead to unexpected results in hard-wrapped text, and\n    also to ambiguities in parsing (note that some implementations\n    put the heading inside the blockquote, while others do not).\n    (John Gruber has also spoken [in favor of requiring the blank\n    lines](https://web.archive.org/web/20170611172104/http://article.gmane.org/gmane.text.markdown.general/2146).)\n\n3.  Is a blank line needed before an indented code block?\n    (`Markdown.pl` requires it, but this is not mentioned in the\n    documentation, and some implementations do not require it.)\n\n    ``` markdown\n    paragraph\n        code?\n    ```\n\n4.  What is the exact rule for determining when list items get\n    wrapped in `<p>` tags?  Can a list be partially "loose" and partially\n    "tight"?  What should we do with a list like this?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    1. one\n\n    2. two\n    3. three\n    ```\n\n    Or this?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    1.  one\n        - a\n\n        - b\n    2.  two\n    ```\n\n    (There are some relevant comments by John Gruber\n    [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170611172104/http://article.gmane.org/gmane.text.markdown.general/2554).)\n\n5.  Can list markers be indented?  Can ordered list markers be right-aligned?\n\n    ``` markdown\n     8. item 1\n     9. item 2\n    10. item 2a\n    ```\n\n6.  Is this one list with a thematic break in its second item,\n    or two lists separated by a thematic break?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    * a\n    * * * * *\n    * b\n    ```\n\n7.  When list markers change from numbers to bullets, do we have\n    two lists or one?  (The Markdown syntax description suggests two,\n    but the perl scripts and many other implementations produce one.)\n\n    ``` markdown\n    1. fee\n    2. fie\n    -  foe\n    -  fum\n    ```\n\n8.  What are the precedence rules for the markers of inline structure?\n    For example, is the following a valid link, or does the code span\n    take precedence ?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    [a backtick (`)](/url) and [another backtick (`)](/url).\n    ```\n\n9.  What are the precedence rules for markers of emphasis and strong\n    emphasis?  For example, how should the following be parsed?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    *foo *bar* baz*\n    ```\n\n10. What are the precedence rules between block-level and inline-level\n    structure?  For example, how should the following be parsed?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    - `a long code span can contain a hyphen like this\n      - and it can screw things up`\n    ```\n\n11. Can list items include section headings?  (`Markdown.pl` does not\n    allow this, but does allow blockquotes to include headings.)\n\n    ``` markdown\n    - # Heading\n    ```\n\n12. Can list items be empty?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    * a\n    *\n    * b\n    ```\n\n13. Can link references be defined inside block quotes or list items?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    > Blockquote [foo].\n    >\n    > [foo]: /url\n    ```\n\n14. If there are multiple definitions for the same reference, which takes\n    precedence?\n\n    ``` markdown\n    [foo]: /url1\n    [foo]: /url2\n\n    [foo][]\n    ```\n\nIn the absence of a spec, early implementers consulted `Markdown.pl`\nto resolve these ambiguities.  But `Markdown.pl` was quite buggy, and\ngave manifestly bad results in many cases, so it was not a\nsatisfactory replacement for a spec.\n\nBecause there is no unambiguous spec, implementations have diverged\nconsiderably.  As a result, users are often surprised to find that\na document that renders one way on one system (say, a GitHub wiki)\nrenders differently on another (say, converting to docbook using\npandoc).  To make matters worse, because nothing in Markdown counts\nas a "syntax error," the divergence often isn\'t discovered right away.\n\n## About this document\n\nThis document attempts to specify Markdown syntax unambiguously.\nIt contains many examples with side-by-side Markdown and\nHTML.  These are intended to double as conformance tests.  An\naccompanying script `spec_tests.py` can be used to run the tests\nagainst any Markdown program:\n\n    python test/spec_tests.py --spec spec.txt --program PROGRAM\n\nSince this document describes how Markdown is to be parsed into\nan abstract syntax tree, it would have made sense to use an abstract\nrepresentation of the syntax tree instead of HTML.  But HTML is capable\nof representing the structural distinctions we need to make, and the\nchoice of HTML for the tests makes it possible to run the tests against\nan implementation without writing an abstract syntax tree renderer.\n\nThis document is generated from a text file, `spec.txt`, written\nin Markdown with a small extension for the side-by-side tests.\nThe script `tools/makespec.py` can be used to convert `spec.txt` into\nHTML or CommonMark (which can then be converted into other formats).\n\nIn the examples, the `→` character is used to represent tabs.\n\n# Preliminaries\n\n## Characters and lines\n\nAny sequence of [characters] is a valid CommonMark\ndocument.\n\nA [character](@) is a Unicode code point.  Although some\ncode points (for example, combining accents) do not correspond to\ncharacters in an intuitive sense, all code points count as characters\nfor purposes of this spec.\n\nThis spec does not specify an encoding; it thinks of lines as composed\nof [characters] rather than bytes.  A conforming parser may be limited\nto a certain encoding.\n\nA [line](@) is a sequence of zero or more [characters]\nother than newline (`U+000A`) or carriage return (`U+000D`),\nfollowed by a [line ending] or by the end of file.\n\nA [line ending](@) is a newline (`U+000A`), a carriage return\n(`U+000D`) not followed by a newline, or a carriage return and a\nfollowing newline.\n\nA line containing no characters, or a line containing only spaces\n(`U+0020`) or tabs (`U+0009`), is called a [blank line](@).\n\nThe following definitions of character classes will be used in this spec:\n\nA [whitespace character](@) is a space\n(`U+0020`), tab (`U+0009`), newline (`U+000A`), line tabulation (`U+000B`),\nform feed (`U+000C`), or carriage return (`U+000D`).\n\n[Whitespace](@) is a sequence of one or more [whitespace\ncharacters].\n\nA [Unicode whitespace character](@) is\nany code point in the Unicode `Zs` general category, or a tab (`U+0009`),\ncarriage return (`U+000D`), newline (`U+000A`), or form feed\n(`U+000C`).\n\n[Unicode whitespace](@) is a sequence of one\nor more [Unicode whitespace characters].\n\nA [space](@) is `U+0020`.\n\nA [non-whitespace character](@) is any character\nthat is not a [whitespace character].\n\nAn [ASCII punctuation character](@)\nis `!`, `"`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `&`, `\'`, `(`, `)`,\n`*`, `+`, `,`, `-`, `.`, `/` (U+0021–2F),\n`:`, `;`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `?`, `@` (U+003A–0040),\n`[`, `\\`, `]`, `^`, `_`, `` ` `` (U+005B–0060),\n`{`, `|`, `}`, or `~` (U+007B–007E).\n\nA [punctuation character](@) is an [ASCII\npunctuation character] or anything in\nthe general Unicode categories  `Pc`, `Pd`, `Pe`, `Pf`, `Pi`, `Po`, or `Ps`.\n\n## Tabs\n\nTabs in lines are not expanded to [spaces].  However,\nin contexts where whitespace helps to define block structure,\ntabs behave as if they were replaced by spaces with a tab stop\nof 4 characters.\n\nThus, for example, a tab can be used instead of four spaces\nin an indented code block.  (Note, however, that internal\ntabs are passed through as literal tabs, not expanded to\nspaces.)\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n→foo→baz→→bim\n.\n<pre><code>foo→baz→→bim\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n  →foo→baz→→bim\n.\n<pre><code>foo→baz→→bim\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n    a→a\n    ὐ→a\n.\n<pre><code>a→a\nὐ→a\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nIn the following example, a continuation paragraph of a list\nitem is indented with a tab; this has exactly the same effect\nas indentation with four spaces would:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n  - foo\n\n→bar\n.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>foo</p>\n<p>bar</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n- foo\n\n→→bar\n.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>foo</p>\n<pre><code>  bar\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nNormally the `>` that begins a block quote may be followed\noptionally by a space, which is not considered part of the\ncontent.  In the following case `>` is followed by a tab,\nwhich is treated as if it were expanded into three spaces.\nSince one of these spaces is considered part of the\ndelimiter, `foo` is considered to be indented six spaces\ninside the block quote context, so we get an indented\ncode block starting with two spaces.\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n>→→foo\n.\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>  foo\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n-→→foo\n.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<pre><code>  foo\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n    foo\n→bar\n.\n<pre><code>foo\nbar\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n - foo\n   - bar\n→ - baz\n.\n<ul>\n<li>foo\n<ul>\n<li>bar\n<ul>\n<li>baz</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n#→Foo\n.\n<h1>Foo</h1>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n*→*→*→\n.\n<hr />\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n## Insecure characters\n\nFor security reasons, the Unicode character `U+0000` must be replaced\nwith the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (`U+FFFD`).\n\n# Blocks and inlines\n\nWe can think of a document as a sequence of\n[blocks](@)---structural elements like paragraphs, block\nquotations, lists, headings, rules, and code blocks.  Some blocks (like\nblock quotes and list items) contain other blocks; others (like\nheadings and paragraphs) contain [inline](@) content---text,\nlinks, emphasized text, images, code spans, and so on.\n\n## Precedence\n\nIndicators of block structure always take precedence over indicators\nof inline structure.  So, for example, the following is a list with\ntwo items, not a list with one item containing a code span:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n- `one\n- two`\n.\n<ul>\n<li>`one</li>\n<li>two`</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThis means that parsing can proceed in two steps:  first, the block\nstructure of the document can be discerned; second, text lines inside\nparagraphs, headings, and other block constructs can be parsed for inline\nstructure.  The second step requires information about link reference\ndefinitions that will be available only at the end of the first\nstep.  Note that the first step requires processing lines in sequence,\nbut the second can be parallelized, since the inline parsing of\none block element does not affect the inline parsing of any other.\n\n## Container blocks and leaf blocks\n\nWe can divide blocks into two types:\n[container blocks](@),\nwhich can contain other blocks, and [leaf blocks](@),\nwhich cannot.\n\n# Leaf blocks\n\nThis section describes the different kinds of leaf block that make up a\nMarkdown document.\n\n## Thematic breaks\n\nA line consisting of 0-3 spaces of indentation, followed by a sequence\nof three or more matching `-`, `_`, or `*` characters, each followed\noptionally by any number of spaces or tabs, forms a\n[thematic break](@).\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n***\n---\n___\n.\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<hr />\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nWrong characters:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n+++\n.\n<p>+++</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n===\n.\n<p>===</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nNot enough characters:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n--\n**\n__\n.\n<p>--\n**\n__</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nOne to three spaces indent are allowed:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n ***\n  ***\n   ***\n.\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<hr />\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nFour spaces is too many:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n    ***\n.\n<pre><code>***\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\nFoo\n    ***\n.\n<p>Foo\n***</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nMore than three characters may be used:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n_____________________________________\n.\n<hr />\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nSpaces are allowed between the characters:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n - - -\n.\n<hr />\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n **  * ** * ** * **\n.\n<hr />\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n-     -      -      -\n.\n<hr />\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nSpaces are allowed at the end:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n- - - -\n.\n<hr />\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nHowever, no other characters may occur in the line:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n_ _ _ _ a\n\na------\n\n---a---\n.\n<p>_ _ _ _ a</p>\n<p>a------</p>\n<p>---a---</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nIt is required that all of the [non-whitespace characters] be the same.\nSo, this is not a thematic break:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n *-*\n.\n<p><em>-</em></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThematic breaks do not need blank lines before or after:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n- foo\n***\n- bar\n.\n<ul>\n<li>foo</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>bar</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThematic breaks can interrupt a paragraph:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\nFoo\n***\nbar\n.\n<p>Foo</p>\n<hr />\n<p>bar</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nIf a line of dashes that meets the above conditions for being a\nthematic break could also be interpreted as the underline of a [setext\nheading], the interpretation as a\n[setext heading] takes precedence. Thus, for example,\nthis is a setext heading, not a paragraph followed by a thematic break:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\nFoo\n---\nbar\n.\n<h2>Foo</h2>\n<p>bar</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nWhen both a thematic break and a list item are possible\ninterpretations of a line, the thematic break takes precedence:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n* Foo\n* * *\n* Bar\n.\n<ul>\n<li>Foo</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>Bar</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nIf you want a thematic break in a list item, use a different bullet:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n- Foo\n- * * *\n.\n<ul>\n<li>Foo</li>\n<li>\n<hr />\n</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n## ATX headings\n\nAn [ATX heading](@)\nconsists of a string of characters, parsed as inline content, between an\nopening sequence of 1--6 unescaped `#` characters and an optional\nclosing sequence of any number of unescaped `#` characters.\nThe opening sequence of `#` characters must be followed by a\n[space] or by the end of line. The optional closing sequence of `#`s must be\npreceded by a [space] and may be followed by spaces only.  The opening\n`#` character may be indented 0-3 spaces.  The raw contents of the\nheading are stripped of leading and trailing spaces before being parsed\nas inline content.  The heading level is equal to the number of `#`\ncharacters in the opening sequence.\n\nSimple headings:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n# foo\n## foo\n### foo\n#### foo\n##### foo\n###### foo\n.\n<h1>foo</h1>\n<h2>foo</h2>\n<h3>foo</h3>\n<h4>foo</h4>\n<h5>foo</h5>\n<h6>foo</h6>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nMore than six `#` characters is not a heading:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n####### foo\n.\n<p>####### foo</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nAt least one space is required between the `#` characters and the\nheading\'s contents, unless the heading is empty.  Note that many\nimplementations currently do not require the space.  However, the\nspace was required by the\n[original ATX implementation](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/atx.py),\nand it helps prevent things like the following from being parsed as\nheadings:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n#5 bolt\n\n#hashtag\n.\n<p>#5 bolt</p>\n<p>#hashtag</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThis is not a heading, because the first `#` is escaped:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n\\## foo\n.\n<p>## foo</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nContents are parsed as inlines:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n# foo *bar* \\*baz\\*\n.\n<h1>foo <em>bar</em> *baz*</h1>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nLeading and trailing [whitespace] is ignored in parsing inline content:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n#                  foo\n.\n<h1>foo</h1>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nOne to three spaces indentation are allowed:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n ### foo\n  ## foo\n   # foo\n.\n<h3>foo</h3>\n<h2>foo</h2>\n<h1>foo</h1>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nFour spaces are too much:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n    # foo\n.\n<pre><code># foo\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\nfoo\n    # bar\n.\n<p>foo\n# bar</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA closing sequence of `#` characters is optional:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n## foo ##\n  ###   bar    ###\n.\n<h2>foo</h2>\n<h3>bar</h3>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nIt need not be the same length as the opening sequence:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n# foo ##################################\n##### foo ##\n.\n<h1>foo</h1>\n<h5>foo</h5>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nSpaces are allowed after the closing sequence:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n### foo ###\n.\n<h3>foo</h3>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA sequence of `#` characters with anything but [spaces] following it\nis not a closing sequence, but counts as part of the contents of the\nheading:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n### foo ### b\n.\n<h3>foo ### b</h3>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe closing sequence must be preceded by a space:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n# foo#\n.\n<h1>foo#</h1>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nBackslash-escaped `#` characters do not count as part\nof the closing sequence:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n### foo \\###\n## foo #\\##\n# foo \\#\n.\n<h3>foo ###</h3>\n<h2>foo ###</h2>\n<h1>foo #</h1>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nATX headings need not be separated from surrounding content by blank\nlines, and they can interrupt paragraphs:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n****\n## foo\n****\n.\n<hr />\n<h2>foo</h2>\n<hr />\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\nFoo bar\n# baz\nBar foo\n.\n<p>Foo bar</p>\n<h1>baz</h1>\n<p>Bar foo</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nATX headings can be empty:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n##\n#\n### ###\n.\n<h2></h2>\n<h1></h1>\n<h3></h3>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n## Setext headings\n\nA [setext heading](@) consists of one or more\nlines of text, each containing at least one [non-whitespace\ncharacter], with no more than 3 spaces indentation, followed by\na [setext heading underline].  The lines of text must be such\nthat, were they not followed by the setext heading underline,\nthey would be interpreted as a paragraph:  they cannot be\ninterpretable as a [code fence], [ATX heading][ATX headings],\n[block quote][block quotes], [thematic break][thematic breaks],\n[list item][list items], or [HTML block][HTML blocks].\n\nA [setext heading underline](@) is a sequence of\n`=` characters or a sequence of `-` characters, with no more than 3\nspaces of indentation and any number of trailing spaces or tabs.\n\nThe heading is a level 1 heading if `=` characters are used in\nthe [setext heading underline], and a level 2 heading if `-`\ncharacters are used.  The contents of the heading are the result\nof parsing the preceding lines of text as CommonMark inline\ncontent.\n\nIn general, a setext heading need not be preceded or followed by a\nblank line.

(Tildes and backticks cannot be mixed.)\nA [fenced code block](@)\nbegins with a code fence, indented no more than three spaces.\n\nThe line with the opening code fence may optionally contain some text\nfollowing the code fence; this is trimmed of leading and trailing\nwhitespace and called the [info string](@). If the [info string] comes\nafter a backtick fence, it may not contain any backtick\ncharacters.  (The reason for this restriction is that otherwise\nsome inline code would be incorrectly interpreted as the\nbeginning of a fenced code block.)\n\nThe content of the code block consists of all subsequent lines, until\na closing [code fence] of the same type as the code block\nbegan with (backticks or tildes), and with at least as many backticks\nor tildes as the opening code fence.  If the leading code fence is\nindented N spaces, then up to N spaces of indentation are removed from\neach line of the content (if present).  (If a content line is not\nindented, it is preserved unchanged.  If it is indented less than N\nspaces, all of the indentation is removed.)\n\nThe closing code fence may be indented up to three spaces, and may be\nfollowed only by spaces, which are ignored.  If the end of the\ncontaining block (or document) is reached and no closing code fence\nhas been found, the code block contains all of the lines after the\nopening code fence until the end of the containing block (or\ndocument).  (An alternative spec would require backtracking in the\nevent that a closing code fence is not found.  But this makes parsing\nmuch less efficient, and there seems to be no real downside to the\nbehavior described here.)\n\nA fenced code block may interrupt a paragraph, and does not require\na blank line either before or after.\n\nThe content of a code fence is treated as literal text, not parsed\nas inlines.  The first word of the [info string] is typically used to\nspecify the language of the code sample, and rendered in the `class`\nattribute of the `code` tag.  However, this spec does not mandate any\nparticular treatment of the [info string].\n\nHere is a simple example with backticks:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n```\n<\n >\n```\n.\n<pre><code>&lt;\n &gt;\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nWith tildes:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n~~~\n<\n >\n~~~\n.\n<pre><code>&lt;\n &gt;\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nFewer than three backticks is not enough:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n``\nfoo\n``\n.\n<p><code>foo</code></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nThe closing code fence must use the same character as the opening\nfence:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n```\naaa\n~~~\n```\n.\n<pre><code>aaa\n~~~\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n~~~\naaa\n```\n~~~\n.\n<pre><code>aaa\n```\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe closing code fence must be at least as long as the opening fence:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n````\naaa\n```\n``````\n.\n<pre><code>aaa\n```\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n~~~~\naaa\n~~~\n~~~~\n.\n<pre><code>aaa\n~~~\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nUnclosed code blocks are closed by the end of the document\n(or the enclosing [block quote][block quotes] or [list item][list items]):\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n```\n.\n<pre><code></code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n`````\n\n```\naaa\n.\n<pre><code>\n```\naaa\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n> ```\n> aaa\n\nbbb\n.\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>aaa\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>bbb</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA code block can have all empty lines as its content:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n```\n\n\n```\n.\n<pre><code>\n\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA code block can be empty:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n```\n```\n.\n<pre><code></code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nFences can be indented.

The block begins with a line that meets a\n[start condition](@) (after up to three spaces optional indentation).\nIt ends with the first subsequent line that meets a matching [end\ncondition](@), or the last line of the document, or the last line of\nthe [container block](#container-blocks) containing the current HTML\nblock, if no line is encountered that meets the [end condition].  If\nthe first line meets both the [start condition] and the [end\ncondition], the block will contain just that line.\n\n1.  **Start condition:**  line begins with the string `<script`,\n`<pre`, or `<style` (case-insensitive), followed by whitespace,\nthe string `>`, or the end of the line.\\\n**End condition:**  line contains an end tag\n`<\/script>`, `</pre>`, or `</style>` (case-insensitive; it\nneed not match the start tag).\n\n2.  **Start condition:** line begins with the string `<!--`.\\\n**End condition:**  line contains the string `-->`.\n\n3.  **Start condition:** line begins with the string `<?`.\\\n**End condition:** line contains the string `?>`.\n\n4.  **Start condition:** line begins with the string `<!`\nfollowed by an uppercase ASCII letter.\\\n**End condition:** line contains the character `>`.\n\n5.  **Start condition:**  line begins with the string\n`<![CDATA[`.\\\n**End condition:** line contains the string `]]>`.\n\n6.  **Start condition:** line begins with the string `<` or `</`\nfollowed by one of the strings (case-insensitive) `address`,\n`article`, `aside`, `base`, `basefont`, `blockquote`, `body`,\n`caption`, `center`, `col`, `colgroup`, `dd`, `details`, `dialog`,\n`dir`, `div`, `dl`, `dt`, `fieldset`, `figcaption`, `figure`,\n`footer`, `form`, `frame`, `frameset`,\n`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `head`, `header`, `hr`,\n`html`, `iframe`, `legend`, `li`, `link`, `main`, `menu`, `menuitem`,\n`nav`, `noframes`, `ol`, `optgroup`, `option`, `p`, `param`,\n`section`, `summary`, `table`, `tbody`, `td`,\n`tfoot`, `th`, `thead`, `title`, `tr`, `track`, `ul`, followed\nby [whitespace], the end of the line, the string `>`, or\nthe string `/>`.\\\n**End condition:** line is followed by a [blank line].\n\n7.  **Start condition:**  line begins with a complete [open tag]\n(with any [tag name] other than `script`,\n`style`, or `pre`) or a complete [closing tag],\nfollowed only by [whitespace] or the end of the line.\\\n**End condition:** line is followed by a [blank line].\n\nHTML blocks continue until they are closed by their appropriate\n[end condition], or the last line of the document or other [container\nblock](#container-blocks).  This means any HTML **within an HTML\nblock** that might otherwise be recognised as a start condition will\nbe ignored by the parser and passed through as-is, without changing\nthe parser\'s state.\n\nFor instance, `<pre>` within a HTML block started by `<table>` will not affect\nthe parser state; as the HTML block was started in by start condition 6, it\nwill end at any blank line.

We can surround content with\n`<del>` tags in three different ways.  In this case, we get a raw\nHTML block, because the `<del>` tag is on a line by itself:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n<del>\n*foo*\n</del>\n.\n<del>\n*foo*\n</del>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nIn this case, we get a raw HTML block that just includes\nthe `<del>` tag (because it ends with the following blank\nline).  So the contents get interpreted as CommonMark:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n<del>\n\n*foo*\n\n</del>\n.\n<del>\n<p><em>foo</em></p>\n</del>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nFinally, in this case, the `<del>` tags are interpreted\nas [raw HTML] *inside* the CommonMark paragraph.  (Because\nthe tag is not on a line by itself, we get inline HTML\nrather than an [HTML block].)\n\n````````````````````````````````

instructions,\nand declarations are treated somewhat differently.\nInstead of ending at the first blank line, these blocks\nend at the first line containing a corresponding end tag.\nAs a result, these blocks can contain blank lines:\n\nA pre tag (type 1):\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n<pre language="haskell"><code>\nimport Text.HTML.TagSoup\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = print $

says:\n\n> The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements —\n> e.g. `<div>`, `<table>`, `<pre>`, `<p>`, etc. — must be separated from\n> surrounding content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the\n> block should not be indented with tabs or spaces.\n\nIn some ways Gruber\'s rule is more restrictive than the one given\nhere:\n\n- It requires that an HTML block be preceded by a blank line.\n- It does not allow the start tag to be indented.\n- It requires a matching end tag, which it also does not allow to\n  be indented.\n\nMost Markdown implementations (including some of Gruber\'s own) do not\nrespect all of these restrictions.\n\nThere is one respect, however, in which Gruber\'s rule is more liberal\nthan the one given here, since it allows blank lines to occur inside\nan HTML block.  There are two reasons for disallowing them here.\nFirst, it removes the need to parse balanced tags, which is\nexpensive and can require backtracking from the end of the document\nif no matching end tag is found. Second, it provides a very simple\nand flexible way of including Markdown content inside HTML tags:\nsimply separate the Markdown from the HTML using blank lines:\n\nCompare:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n<div>\n\n*Emphasized* text.\n\n</div>\n.\n<div>\n<p><em>Emphasized</em> text.</p>\n</div>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n<div>\n*Emphasized* text.\n</div>\n.\n<div>\n*Emphasized* text.\n</div>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nSome Markdown implementations have adopted a convention of\ninterpreting content inside tags as text if the open tag has\nthe attribute `markdown=1`.  The rule given above seems a simpler and\nmore elegant way of achieving the same expressive power, which is also\nmuch simpler to parse.\n\nThe main potential drawback is that one can no longer paste HTML\nblocks into Markdown documents with 100% reliability.  However,\n*in most cases* this will work fine, because the blank lines in\nHTML are usually followed by HTML block tags.  For example:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td>\nHi\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n.\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\nHi\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThere are problems, however, if the inner tags are indented\n*and* separated by spaces, as then they will be interpreted as\nan indented code block:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n<table>\n\n  <tr>\n\n    <td>\n      Hi\n    </td>\n\n  </tr>\n\n</table>\n.\n<table>\n  <tr>\n<pre><code>&lt;td&gt;\n  Hi\n&lt;/td&gt;\n</code></pre>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nFortunately, blank lines are usually not necessary and can be\ndeleted.  The exception is inside `<pre>` tags, but as described\n[above][HTML blocks], raw HTML blocks starting with `<pre>`\n*can* contain blank lines.\n\n## Link reference definitions\n\nA [link reference definition](@)\nconsists of a [link label], indented up to three spaces, followed\nby a colon (`:`), optional [whitespace] (including up to one\n[line ending]), a [link destination],\noptional [whitespace] (including up to one\n[line ending]), and an optional [link\ntitle], which if it is present must be separated\nfrom the [link destination] by [whitespace].\nNo further [non-whitespace characters] may occur on the line.\n\nA [link reference definition]\ndoes not correspond to a structural element of a document.  Instead, it\ndefines a label which can be used in [reference links]\nand reference-style [images] elsewhere in the document.  [Link\nreference definitions] can come either before or after the links that use\nthem.\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]: /url "title"\n\n[foo]\n.\n<p><a href="/url" title="title">foo</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n   [foo]:\n      /url\n           \'the title\'\n\n[foo]\n.\n<p><a href="/url" title="the title">foo</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[Foo*bar\\]]:my_(url) \'title (with parens)\'\n\n[Foo*bar\\]]\n.\n<p><a href="my_(url)" title="title (with parens)">Foo*bar]</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[Foo bar]:\n<my url>\n\'title\'\n\n[Foo bar]\n.\n<p><a href="my%20url" title="title">Foo bar</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe title may extend over multiple lines:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]: /url \'\ntitle\nline1\nline2\n\'\n\n[foo]\n.\n<p><a href="/url" title="\ntitle\nline1\nline2\n">foo</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nHowever, it may not contain a [blank line]:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]: /url \'title\n\nwith blank line\'\n\n[foo]\n.\n<p>[foo]: /url \'title</p>\n<p>with blank line\'</p>\n<p>[foo]</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe title may be omitted:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]:\n/url\n\n[foo]\n.\n<p><a href="/url">foo</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe link destination may not be omitted:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]:\n\n[foo]\n.\n<p>[foo]:</p>\n<p>[foo]</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n However, an empty link destination may be specified using\n angle brackets:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]: <>\n\n[foo]\n.\n<p><a href="">foo</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nThe title must be separated from the link destination by\nwhitespace:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]: <bar>(baz)\n\n[foo]\n.\n<p>[foo]: <bar>(baz)</p>\n<p>[foo]</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nBoth title and destination can contain backslash escapes\nand literal backslashes:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]: /url\\bar\\*baz "foo\\"bar\\baz"\n\n[foo]\n.\n<p><a href="/url%5Cbar*baz" title="foo&quot;bar\\baz">foo</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA link can come before its corresponding definition:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]\n\n[foo]: url\n.\n<p><a href="url">foo</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nIf there are several matching definitions, the first one takes\nprecedence:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]\n\n[foo]: first\n[foo]: second\n.\n<p><a href="first">foo</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nAs noted in the section on [Links], matching of labels is\ncase-insensitive (see [matches]).\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[FOO]: /url\n\n[Foo]\n.\n<p><a href="/url">Foo</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[ΑΓΩ]: /φου\n\n[αγω]\n.\n<p><a href="/%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%85">αγω</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nHere is a link reference definition with no corresponding link.\nIt contributes nothing to the document.\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]: /url\n.\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nHere is another one:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[\nfoo\n]: /url\nbar\n.\n<p>bar</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThis is not a link reference definition, because there are\n[non-whitespace characters] after the title:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo]: /url "title" ok\n.\n<p>[foo]: /url &quot;title&quot;

There are two basic kinds of container blocks:\n[block quotes] and [list items].\n[Lists] are meta-containers for [list items].\n\nWe define the syntax for container blocks recursively.  The general\nform of the definition is:\n\n> If X is a sequence of blocks, then the result of\n> transforming X in such-and-such a way is a container of type Y\n> with these blocks as its content.\n\nSo, we explain what counts as a block quote or list item by explaining\nhow these can be *generated* from their contents. This should suffice\nto define the syntax, although it does not give a recipe for *parsing*\nthese constructions.  (A recipe is provided below in the section entitled\n[A parsing strategy](#appendix-a-parsing-strategy).)\n\n## Block quotes\n\nA [block quote marker](@)\nconsists of 0-3 spaces of initial indent, plus (a) the character `>` together\nwith a following space, or (b) a single character `>` not followed by a space.\n\nThe following rules define [block quotes]:\n\n1.  **Basic case.**  If a string of lines *Ls* constitute a sequence\n    of blocks *Bs*, then the result of prepending a [block quote\n    marker] to the beginning of each line in *Ls*\n    is a [block quote](#block-quotes) containing *Bs*.\n\n2.  **Laziness.**  If a string of lines *Ls* constitute a [block\n    quote](#block-quotes) with contents *Bs*, then the result of deleting\n    the initial [block quote marker] from one or\n    more lines in which the next [non-whitespace character] after the [block\n    quote marker] is [paragraph continuation\n    text] is a block quote with *Bs* as its content.\n    [Paragraph continuation text](@) is text\n    that will be parsed as part of the content of a paragraph, but does\n    not occur at the beginning of the paragraph.\n\n3.  **Consecutiveness.**  A document cannot contain two [block\n    quotes] in a row unless there is a [blank line] between them.\n\nNothing else counts as a [block quote](#block-quotes).\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n> # Foo\n> bar\n> baz\n.\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Foo</h1>\n<p>bar\nbaz</p>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe spaces after the `>` characters can be omitted:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n># Foo\n>bar\n> baz\n.\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Foo</h1>\n<p>bar\nbaz</p>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe `>` characters can be indented 1-3 spaces:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n   > # Foo\n   > bar\n > baz\n.\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Foo</h1>\n<p>bar\nbaz</p>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nFour spaces gives us a code block:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n    > # Foo\n    > bar\n    > baz\n.\n<pre><code>&gt; # Foo\n&gt; bar\n&gt; baz\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe Laziness clause allows us to omit the `>` before\n[paragraph continuation text]:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n> # Foo\n> bar\nbaz\n.\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Foo</h1>\n<p>bar\nbaz</p>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA block quote can contain some lazy and some non-lazy\ncontinuation lines:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n> bar\nbaz\n> foo\n.\n<blockquote>\n<p>bar\nbaz\nfoo</p>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nLaziness only applies to lines that would have been continuations of\nparagraphs had they been prepended with [block quote markers].\nFor example, the `> ` cannot be omitted in the second line of\n\n``` markdown\n> foo\n> ---\n```\n\nwithout changing the meaning:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n> foo\n---\n.\n<blockquote>\n<p>foo</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nSimilarly, if we omit the `> ` in the second line of\n\n``` markdown\n> - foo\n> - bar\n```\n\nthen the block quote ends after the first line:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n> - foo\n- bar\n.\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>foo</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>bar</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nFor the same reason, we can\'t omit the `> ` in front of\nsubsequent lines of an indented or fenced code block:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n>     foo\n    bar\n.\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>foo\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>bar\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n> ```\nfoo\n```\n.\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code></code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>foo</p>\n<pre><code></code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nNote that in the following case, we have a [lazy\ncontinuation line]:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n> foo\n    - bar\n.\n<blockquote>\n<p>foo\n- bar</p>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nTo see why, note that in\n\n```markdown\n> foo\n>     - bar\n```\n\nthe `- bar` is indented too far to start a list, and can\'t\nbe an indented code block because indented code blocks cannot\ninterrupt paragraphs, so it is [paragraph continuation text].\n\nA block quote can be empty:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n>\n.\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n>\n>\n>\n.\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA block quote can have initial or final blank lines:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n>\n> foo\n>\n.\n<blockquote>\n<p>foo</p>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA blank line always separates block quotes:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n> foo\n\n> bar\n.\n<blockquote>\n<p>foo</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>bar</p>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n(Most current Markdown implementations, including John Gruber\'s\noriginal `Markdown.pl`, will parse this example as a single block quote\nwith two paragraphs.

(The reason for the length\nlimit is that with 10 digits we start seeing integer overflows\nin some browsers.)\n\nThe following rules define [list items]:\n\n1.  **Basic case.**  If a sequence of lines *Ls* constitute a sequence of\n    blocks *Bs* starting with a [non-whitespace character], and *M* is a\n    list marker of width *W* followed by 1 ≤ *N* ≤ 4 spaces, then the result\n    of prepending *M* and the following spaces to the first line of\n    *Ls*, and indenting subsequent lines of *Ls* by *W + N* spaces, is a\n    list item with *Bs* as its contents.  The type of the list item\n    (bullet or ordered) is determined by the type of its list marker.\n    If the list item is ordered, then it is also assigned a start\n    number, based on the ordered list marker.\n\n    Exceptions:\n\n    1. When the first list item in a [list] interrupts\n    a paragraph---that is, when it starts on a line that would\n    otherwise count as [paragraph continuation text]---then (a)\n    the lines *Ls* must not begin with a blank line, and (b) if\n    the list item is ordered, the start number must be 1.\n    2. If any line is a [thematic break][thematic breaks] then\n       that line is not a list item.\n\nFor example, let *Ls* be the lines\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\nA paragraph\nwith two lines.\n\n    indented code\n\n> A block quote.\n.\n<p>A paragraph\nwith two lines.</p>\n<pre><code>indented code\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A block quote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nAnd let *M* be the marker `1.`, and *N* = 2.  Then rule #1 says\nthat the following is an ordered list item with start number 1,\nand the same contents as *Ls*:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n1.  A paragraph\n    with two lines.\n\n        indented code\n\n    > A block quote.\n.\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A paragraph\nwith two lines.</p>\n<pre><code>indented code\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A block quote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe most important thing to notice is that the position of\nthe text after the list marker determines how much indentation\nis needed in subsequent blocks in the list item.  If the list\nmarker takes up two spaces, and there are three spaces between\nthe list marker and the next [non-whitespace character], then blocks\nmust be indented five spaces in order to fall under the list\nitem.\n\nHere are some examples showing how far content must be indented to be\nput under the list item:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n- one\n\n two\n.\n<ul>\n<li>one</li>\n</ul>\n<p>two</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n- one\n\n  two\n.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>one</p>\n<p>two</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n -    one\n\n     two\n.\n<ul>\n<li>one</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code> two\n</code></pre>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n -    one\n\n      two\n.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>one</p>\n<p>two</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nIt is tempting to think of this in terms of columns:  the continuation\nblocks must be indented at least to the column of the first\n[non-whitespace character] after the list marker. However, that is not quite right.\nThe spaces after the list marker determine how much relative indentation\nis needed.  Which column this indentation reaches will depend on\nhow the list item is embedded in other constructions, as shown by\nthis example:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n   > > 1.  one\n>>\n>>     two\n.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>one</p>\n<p>two</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nHere `two` occurs in the same column as the list marker `1.`,\nbut is actually contained in the list item, because there is\nsufficient indentation after the last containing blockquote marker.\n\nThe converse is also possible.  In the following example, the word `two`\noccurs far to the right of the initial text of the list item, `one`, but\nit is not considered part of the list item, because it is not indented\nfar enough past the blockquote marker:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n>>- one\n>>\n  >  > two\n.\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>one</li>\n</ul>\n<p>two</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nNote that at least one space is needed between the list marker and\nany following content, so these are not list items:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n-one\n\n2.two\n.\n<p>-one</p>\n<p>2.two</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA list item may contain blocks that are separated by more than\none blank line.\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n- foo\n\n\n  bar\n.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>foo</p>\n<p>bar</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA list item may contain any kind of block:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n1.  foo\n\n    ```\n    bar\n    ```\n\n    baz\n\n    > bam\n.\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>foo</p>\n<pre><code>bar\n</code></pre>\n<p>baz</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>bam</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA list item that contains an indented code block will preserve\nempty lines within the code block verbatim.\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n- Foo\n\n      bar\n\n\n      baz\n.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Foo</p>\n<pre><code>bar\n\n\nbaz\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nNote that ordered list start numbers must be nine digits or less:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n123456789. ok\n.\n<ol start="123456789">\n<li>ok</li>\n</ol>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n1234567890. not ok\n.\n<p>1234567890. not ok</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA start number may begin with 0s:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n0. ok\n.\n<ol start="0">\n<li>ok</li>\n</ol>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n003. ok\n.\n<ol start="3">\n<li>ok</li>\n</ol>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA start number may not be negative:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n-1. not ok\n.\n<p>-1. not ok</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n\n2.  **Item starting with indented code.**  If a sequence of lines *Ls*\n    constitute a sequence of blocks *Bs* starting with an indented code\n    block, and *M* is a list marker of width *W* followed by\n    one space, then the result of prepending *M* and the following\n    space to the first line of *Ls*, and indenting subsequent lines of\n    *Ls* by *W + 1* spaces, is a list item with *Bs* as its contents.\n    If a line is empty, then it need not be indented.  The type of the\n    list item (bullet or ordered) is determined by the type of its list\n    marker.

"List markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented\n   by up to three spaces. List markers must be followed by one or more\n   spaces or a tab."\n\n2. "To make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents....\n   But if you don\'t want to, you don\'t have to."\n\n3. "List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent\n   paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one\n   tab."\n\n4. "It looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent paragraphs,\n   but here again, Markdown will allow you to be lazy."\n\n5. "To put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote\'s `>`\n   delimiters need to be indented."\n\n6. "To put a code block within a list item, the code block needs to be\n   indented twice — 8 spaces or two tabs."\n\nThese rules specify that a paragraph under a list item must be indented\nfour spaces (presumably, from the left margin, rather than the start of\nthe list marker, but this is not said), and that code under a list item\nmust be indented eight spaces instead of the usual four.  They also say\nthat a block quote must be indented, but not by how much; however, the\nexample given has four spaces indentation.  Although nothing is said\nabout other kinds of block-level content, it is certainly reasonable to\ninfer that *all* block elements under a list item, including other\nlists, must be indented four spaces.  This principle has been called the\n*four-space rule*.\n\nThe four-space rule is clear and principled, and if the reference\nimplementation `Markdown.pl` had followed it, it probably would have\nbecome the standard.  However, `Markdown.pl` allowed paragraphs and\nsublists to start with only two spaces indentation, at least on the\nouter level.  Worse, its behavior was inconsistent: a sublist of an\nouter-level list needed two spaces indentation, but a sublist of this\nsublist needed three spaces.  It is not surprising, then, that different\nimplementations of Markdown have developed very different rules for\ndetermining what comes under a list item.  (Pandoc and python-Markdown,\nfor example, stuck with Gruber\'s syntax description and the four-space\nrule, while discount, redcarpet, marked, PHP Markdown, and others\nfollowed `Markdown.pl`\'s behavior more closely.)\n\nUnfortunately, given the divergences between implementations, there\nis no way to give a spec for list items that will be guaranteed not\nto break any existing documents.  However, the spec given here should\ncorrectly handle lists formatted with either the four-space rule or\nthe more forgiving `Markdown.pl` behavior, provided they are laid out\nin a way that is natural for a human to read.\n\nThe strategy here is to let the width and indentation of the list marker\ndetermine the indentation necessary for blocks to fall under the list\nitem, rather than having a fixed and arbitrary number.  The writer can\nthink of the body of the list item as a unit which gets indented to the\nright enough to fit the list marker (and any indentation on the list\nmarker).  (The laziness rule, #5, then allows continuation lines to be\nunindented if needed.)\n\nThis rule is superior, we claim, to any rule requiring a fixed level of\nindentation from the margin.  The four-space rule is clear but\nunnatural. It is quite unintuitive that\n\n``` markdown\n- foo\n\n  bar\n\n  - baz\n```\n\nshould be parsed as two lists with an intervening paragraph,\n\n``` html\n<ul>\n<li>foo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>bar</p>\n<ul>\n<li>baz</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nas the four-space rule demands, rather than a single list,\n\n``` html\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>foo</p>\n<p>bar</p>\n<ul>\n<li>baz</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nThe choice of four spaces is arbitrary.  It can be learned, but it is\nnot likely to be guessed, and it trips up beginners regularly.\n\nWould it help to adopt a two-space rule?  The problem is that such\na rule, together with the rule allowing 1--3 spaces indentation of the\ninitial list marker, allows text that is indented *less than* the\noriginal list marker to be included in the list item. For example,\n`Markdown.pl` parses\n\n``` markdown\n   - one\n\n  two\n```\n\nas a single list item, with `two` a continuation paragraph:\n\n``` html\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>one</p>\n<p>two</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nand similarly\n\n``` markdown\n>   - one\n>\n>  two\n```\n\nas\n\n``` html\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>one</p>\n<p>two</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n```\n\nThis is extremely unintuitive.\n\nRather than requiring a fixed indent from the margin, we could require\na fixed indent (say, two spaces, or even one space) from the list marker (which\nmay itself be indented).  This proposal would remove the last anomaly\ndiscussed.  Unlike the spec presented above, it would count the following\nas a list item with a subparagraph, even though the paragraph `bar`\nis not indented as far as the first paragraph `foo`:\n\n``` markdown\n 10. foo\n\n   bar\n```\n\nArguably this text does read like a list item with `bar` as a subparagraph,\nwhich may count in favor of the proposal.  However, on this proposal indented\ncode would have to be indented six spaces after the list marker.  And this\nwould break a lot of existing Markdown, which has the pattern:\n\n``` markdown\n1.  foo\n\n        indented code\n```\n\nwhere the code is indented eight spaces.  The spec above, by contrast, will\nparse this text as expected, since the code block\'s indentation is measured\nfrom the beginning of `foo`.\n\nThe one case that needs special treatment is a list item that *starts*\nwith indented code.  How much indentation is required in that case, since\nwe don\'t have a "first paragraph" to measure from?  Rule #2 simply stipulates\nthat in such cases, we require one space indentation from the list marker\n(and then the normal four spaces for the indented code).  This will match the\nfour-space rule in cases where the list marker plus its initial indentation\ntakes four spaces (a common case), but diverge in other cases.\n\n<div class="extension">\n\n## Task list items (extension)\n\nGFM enables the `tasklist` extension, where an additional processing step is\nperformed on [list items].\n\nA [task list item](@) is a [list item][list items] where the first block in it\nis a paragraph which begins with a [task list item marker] and at least one\nwhitespace character before any other content.\n\nA [task list item marker](@) consists of an optional number of spaces, a left\nbracket (`[`), either a whitespace character or the letter `x` in either\nlowercase or uppercase, and then a right bracket (`]`).\n\nWhen rendered, the [task list item marker] is replaced with a semantic checkbox element;\nin an HTML output, this would be an `<input type="checkbox">` element.\n\nIf the character between the brackets is a whitespace character, the checkbox\nis unchecked.  Otherwise, the checkbox is checked.\n\nThis spec does not define how the checkbox elements are interacted with: in practice,\nimplementors are free to render the checkboxes as disabled or inmutable elements,\nor they may dynamically handle dynamic interactions (i.e. checking, unchecking) in\nthe final rendered document.\n\n```````````````````````````````` example disabled\n- [ ] foo\n- [x] bar\n.\n<ul>\n<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> foo</li>\n<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> bar</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nTask lists can be arbitrarily nested:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example disabled\n- [x] foo\n  - [ ] bar\n  - [x] baz\n- [ ] bim\n.\n<ul>\n<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> foo\n<ul>\n<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> bar</li>\n<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> baz</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> bim</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n</div>\n\n## Lists\n\nA [list](@) is a sequence of one or more\nlist items [of the same type].  The list items\nmay be separated by any number of blank lines.\n\nTwo list items are [of the same type](@)\nif they begin with a [list marker] of the same type.\nTwo list markers are of the\nsame type if (a) they are bullet list markers using the same character\n(`-`, `+`, or `*`) or (b) they are ordered list numbers with the same\ndelimiter (either `.` or `)`).\n\nA list is an [ordered list](@)\nif its constituent list items begin with\n[ordered list markers], and a\n[bullet list](@) if its constituent list\nitems begin with [bullet list markers].\n\nThe [start number](@)\nof an [ordered list] is determined by the list number of\nits initial list item.  The numbers of subsequent list items are\ndisregarded.\n\nA list is [loose](@) if any of its constituent\nlist items are separated by blank lines, or if any of its constituent\nlist items directly contain two block-level elements with a blank line\nbetween them.  Otherwise a list is [tight](@).\n(The difference in HTML output is that paragraphs in a loose list are\nwrapped in `<p>` tags, while paragraphs in a tight list are not.)\n\nChanging the bullet or ordered list delimiter starts a new list:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n- foo\n- bar\n+ baz\n.\n<ul>\n<li>foo</li>\n<li>bar</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>baz</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n1. foo\n2. bar\n3) baz\n.\n<ol>\n<li>foo</li>\n<li>bar</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start="3">\n<li>baz</li>\n</ol>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nIn CommonMark, a list can interrupt a paragraph. That is,\nno blank line is needed to separate a paragraph from a following\nlist:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\nFoo\n- bar\n- baz\n.\n<p>Foo</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bar</li>\n<li>baz</li>\n</ul>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n`Markdown.pl` does not allow this, through fear of triggering a list\nvia a numeral in a hard-wrapped line:\n\n``` markdown\nThe number of windows in my house is\n14.  The number of doors is 6.\n```\n\nOddly, though, `Markdown.pl` *does* allow a blockquote to\ninterrupt a paragraph, even though the same considerations might\napply.\n\nIn CommonMark, we do allow lists to interrupt paragraphs, for\ntwo reasons.  First, it is natural and not uncommon for people\nto start lists without blank lines:\n\n``` markdown\nI need to buy\n- new shoes\n- a coat\n- a plane ticket\n```\n\nSecond, we are attracted to a\n\n> [principle of uniformity](@):\n> if a chunk of text has a certain\n> meaning, it will continue to have the same meaning when put into a\n> container block (such as a list item or blockquote).\n\n(Indeed, the spec for [list items] and [block quotes] presupposes\nthis principle.) This principle implies that if\n\n``` markdown\n  * I need to buy\n    - new shoes\n    - a coat\n    - a plane ticket\n```\n\nis a list item containing a paragraph followed by a nested sublist,\nas all Markdown implementations agree it is (though the paragraph\nmay be rendered without `<p>` tags, since the list is "tight"),\nthen\n\n``` markdown\nI need to buy\n- new shoes\n- a coat\n- a plane ticket\n```\n\nby itself should be a paragraph followed by a nested sublist.\n\nSince it is well established Markdown practice to allow lists to\ninterrupt paragraphs inside list items, the [principle of\nuniformity] requires us to allow this outside list items as\nwell.  ([reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)\ntakes a different approach, requiring blank lines before lists\neven inside other list items.)\n\nIn order to solve the problem of unwanted lists in paragraphs with\nhard-wrapped numerals, we allow only lists starting with `1` to\ninterrupt paragraphs.  Thus,\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\nThe number of windows in my house is\n14.  The number of doors is 6.\n.\n<p>The number of windows in my house is\n14.  The number of doors is 6.</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nWe may still get an unintended result in cases like\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\nThe number of windows in my house is\n1.

Text wrapped with one `*` or `_` will be wrapped with an HTML\n> `<em>` tag; double `*`\'s or `_`\'s will be wrapped with an HTML `<strong>`\n> tag.\n\nThis is enough for most users, but these rules leave much undecided,\nespecially when it comes to nested emphasis.  The original\n`Markdown.pl` test suite makes it clear that triple `***` and\n`___` delimiters can be used for strong emphasis, and most\nimplementations have also allowed the following patterns:\n\n``` markdown\n***strong emph***\n***strong** in emph*\n***emph* in strong**\n**in strong *emph***\n*in emph **strong***\n```\n\nThe following patterns are less widely supported, but the intent\nis clear and they are useful (especially in contexts like bibliography\nentries):\n\n``` markdown\n*emph *with emph* in it*\n**strong **with strong** in it**\n```\n\nMany implementations have also restricted intraword emphasis to\nthe `*` forms, to avoid unwanted emphasis in words containing\ninternal underscores.  (It is best practice to put these in code\nspans, but users often do not.)\n\n``` markdown\ninternal emphasis: foo*bar*baz\nno emphasis: foo_bar_baz\n```\n\nThe rules given below capture all of these patterns, while allowing\nfor efficient parsing strategies that do not backtrack.\n\nFirst, some definitions.  A [delimiter run](@) is either\na sequence of one or more `*` characters that is not preceded or\nfollowed by a non-backslash-escaped `*` character, or a sequence\nof one or more `_` characters that is not preceded or followed by\na non-backslash-escaped `_` character.\n\nA [left-flanking delimiter run](@) is\na [delimiter run] that is (1) not followed by [Unicode whitespace],\nand either (2a) not followed by a [punctuation character], or\n(2b) followed by a [punctuation character] and\npreceded by [Unicode whitespace] or a [punctuation character].\nFor purposes of this definition, the beginning and the end of\nthe line count as Unicode whitespace.\n\nA [right-flanking delimiter run](@) is\na [delimiter run] that is (1) not preceded by [Unicode whitespace],\nand either (2a) not preceded by a [punctuation character], or\n(2b) preceded by a [punctuation character] and\nfollowed by [Unicode whitespace] or a [punctuation character].\nFor purposes of this definition, the beginning and the end of\nthe line count as Unicode whitespace.\n\nHere are some examples of delimiter runs.\n\n  - left-flanking but not right-flanking:\n\n    ```\n    ***abc\n      _abc\n    **"abc"\n     _"abc"\n    ```\n\n  - right-flanking but not left-flanking:\n\n    ```\n     abc***\n     abc_\n    "abc"**\n    "abc"_\n    ```\n\n  - Both left and right-flanking:\n\n    ```\n     abc***def\n    "abc"_"def"\n    ```\n\n  - Neither left nor right-flanking:\n\n    ```\n    abc *** def\n    a _ b\n    ```\n\n(The idea of distinguishing left-flanking and right-flanking\ndelimiter runs based on the character before and the character\nafter comes from Roopesh Chander\'s\n[vfmd](http://www.vfmd.org/vfmd-spec/specification/#procedure-for-identifying-emphasis-tags).\nvfmd uses the terminology "emphasis indicator string" instead of "delimiter\nrun," and its rules for distinguishing left- and right-flanking runs\nare a bit more complex than the ones given here.)\n\nThe following rules define emphasis and strong emphasis:\n\n1.  A single `*` character [can open emphasis](@)\n    iff (if and only if) it is part of a [left-flanking delimiter run].\n\n2.  A single `_` character [can open emphasis] iff\n    it is part of a [left-flanking delimiter run]\n    and either (a) not part of a [right-flanking delimiter run]\n    or (b) part of a [right-flanking delimiter run]\n    preceded by punctuation.\n\n3.  A single `*` character [can close emphasis](@)\n    iff it is part of a [right-flanking delimiter run].\n\n4.  A single `_` character [can close emphasis] iff\n    it is part of a [right-flanking delimiter run]\n    and either (a) not part of a [left-flanking delimiter run]\n    or (b) part of a [left-flanking delimiter run]\n    followed by punctuation.\n\n5.  A double `**` [can open strong emphasis](@)\n    iff it is part of a [left-flanking delimiter run].\n\n6.  A double `__` [can open strong emphasis] iff\n    it is part of a [left-flanking delimiter run]\n    and either (a) not part of a [right-flanking delimiter run]\n    or (b) part of a [right-flanking delimiter run]\n    preceded by punctuation.\n\n7.  A double `**` [can close strong emphasis](@)\n    iff it is part of a [right-flanking delimiter run].\n\n8.  A double `__` [can close strong emphasis] iff\n    it is part of a [right-flanking delimiter run]\n    and either (a) not part of a [left-flanking delimiter run]\n    or (b) part of a [left-flanking delimiter run]\n    followed by punctuation.\n\n9.  Emphasis begins with a delimiter that [can open emphasis] and ends\n    with a delimiter that [can close emphasis], and that uses the same\n    character (`_` or `*`) as the opening delimiter.  The\n    opening and closing delimiters must belong to separate\n    [delimiter runs].  If one of the delimiters can both\n    open and close emphasis, then the sum of the lengths of the\n    delimiter runs containing the opening and closing delimiters\n    must not be a multiple of 3 unless both lengths are\n    multiples of 3.\n\n10. Strong emphasis begins with a delimiter that\n    [can open strong emphasis] and ends with a delimiter that\n    [can close strong emphasis], and that uses the same character\n    (`_` or `*`) as the opening delimiter.  The\n    opening and closing delimiters must belong to separate\n    [delimiter runs].  If one of the delimiters can both open\n    and close strong emphasis, then the sum of the lengths of\n    the delimiter runs containing the opening and closing\n    delimiters must not be a multiple of 3 unless both lengths\n    are multiples of 3.\n\n11. A literal `*` character cannot occur at the beginning or end of\n    `*`-delimited emphasis or `**`-delimited strong emphasis, unless it\n    is backslash-escaped.\n\n12. A literal `_` character cannot occur at the beginning or end of\n    `_`-delimited emphasis or `__`-delimited strong emphasis, unless it\n    is backslash-escaped.\n\nWhere rules 1--12 above are compatible with multiple parsings,\nthe following principles resolve ambiguity:\n\n13. The number of nestings should be minimized. Thus, for example,\n    an interpretation `<strong>...</strong>` is always preferred to\n    `<em><em>...</em></em>`.\n\n14. An interpretation `<em><strong>...</strong></em>` is always\n    preferred to `<strong><em>...</em></strong>`.\n\n15. When two potential emphasis or strong emphasis spans overlap,\n    so that the second begins before the first ends and ends after\n    the first ends, the first takes precedence. Thus, for example,\n    `*foo _bar* baz_` is parsed as `<em>foo _bar</em> baz_` rather\n    than `*foo <em>bar* baz</em>`.\n\n16. When there are two potential emphasis or strong emphasis spans\n    with the same closing delimiter, the shorter one (the one that\n    opens later) takes precedence. Thus, for example,\n    `**foo **bar baz**` is parsed as `**foo <strong>bar baz</strong>`\n    rather than `<strong>foo **bar baz</strong>`.\n\n17. Inline code spans, links, images, and HTML tags group more tightly\n    than emphasis.  So, when there is a choice between an interpretation\n    that contains one of these elements and one that does not, the\n    former always wins.  Thus, for example, `*[foo*](bar)` is\n    parsed as `*<a href="bar">foo*</a>` rather than as\n    `<em>[foo</em>](bar)`.\n\nThese rules can be illustrated through a series of examples.\n\nRule 1:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n*foo bar*\n.\n<p><em>foo bar</em></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThis is not emphasis, because the opening `*` is followed by\nwhitespace,

Links\n\nA link contains [link text] (the visible text), a [link destination]\n(the URI that is the link destination), and optionally a [link title].\nThere are two basic kinds of links in Markdown.  In [inline links] the\ndestination and title are given immediately after the link text.  In\n[reference links] the destination and title are defined elsewhere in\nthe document.\n\nA [link text](@) consists of a sequence of zero or more\ninline elements enclosed by square brackets (`[` and `]`).  The\nfollowing rules apply:\n\n- Links may not contain other links, at any level of nesting. If\n  multiple otherwise valid link definitions appear nested inside each\n  other, the inner-most definition is used.\n\n- Brackets are allowed in the [link text] only if (a) they\n  are backslash-escaped or (b) they appear as a matched pair of brackets,\n  with an open bracket `[`, a sequence of zero or more inlines, and\n  a close bracket `]`.\n\n- Backtick [code spans], [autolinks], and raw [HTML tags] bind more tightly\n  than the brackets in link text.  Thus, for example,\n  `` [foo`]` `` could not be a link text, since the second `]`\n  is part of a code span.\n\n- The brackets in link text bind more tightly than markers for\n  [emphasis and strong emphasis]. Thus, for example, `*[foo*](url)` is a link.\n\nA [link destination](@) consists of either\n\n- a sequence of zero or more characters between an opening `<` and a\n  closing `>` that contains no line breaks or unescaped\n  `<` or `>` characters, or\n\n- a nonempty sequence of characters that does not start with\n  `<`, does not include ASCII space or control characters, and\n  includes parentheses only if (a) they are backslash-escaped or\n  (b) they are part of a balanced pair of unescaped parentheses.\n  (Implementations may impose limits on parentheses nesting to\n  avoid performance issues, but at least three levels of nesting\n  should be supported.)\n\nA [link title](@)  consists of either\n\n- a sequence of zero or more characters between straight double-quote\n  characters (`"`), including a `"` character only if it is\n  backslash-escaped, or\n\n- a sequence of zero or more characters between straight single-quote\n  characters (`\'`), including a `\'` character only if it is\n  backslash-escaped, or\n\n- a sequence of zero or more characters between matching parentheses\n  (`(...)`), including a `(` or `)` character only if it is\n  backslash-escaped.\n\nAlthough [link titles] may span multiple lines, they may not contain\na [blank line].\n\nAn [inline link](@) consists of a [link text] followed immediately\nby a left parenthesis `(`, optional [whitespace], an optional\n[link destination], an optional [link title] separated from the link\ndestination by [whitespace], optional [whitespace], and a right\nparenthesis `)`. The link\'s text consists of the inlines contained\nin the [link text] (excluding the enclosing square brackets).\nThe link\'s URI consists of the link destination, excluding enclosing\n`<...>` if present, with backslash-escapes in effect as described\nabove.  The link\'s title consists of the link title, excluding its\nenclosing delimiters, with backslash-escapes in effect as described\nabove.\n\nHere is a simple inline link:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](/uri "title")\n.\n<p><a href="/uri" title="title">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe title may be omitted:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](/uri)\n.\n<p><a href="/uri">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nBoth the title and the destination may be omitted:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link]()\n.\n<p><a href="">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](<>)\n.\n<p><a href="">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nThe destination can only contain spaces if it is\nenclosed in pointy brackets:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](/my uri)\n.\n<p>[link](/my uri)</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](</my uri>)\n.\n<p><a href="/my%20uri">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nThe destination cannot contain line breaks,\neven if enclosed in pointy brackets:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](foo\nbar)\n.\n<p>[link](foo\nbar)</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](<foo\nbar>)\n.\n<p>[link](<foo\nbar>)</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nThe destination can contain `)` if it is enclosed\nin pointy brackets:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[a](<b)c>)\n.\n<p><a href="b)c">a</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nPointy brackets that enclose links must be unescaped:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](<foo\\>)\n.\n<p>[link](&lt;foo&gt;)</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nThese are not links, because the opening pointy bracket\nis not matched properly:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[a](<b)c\n[a](<b)c>\n[a](<b>c)\n.\n<p>[a](&lt;b)c\n[a](&lt;b)c&gt;\n[a](<b>c)</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nParentheses inside the link destination may be escaped:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](\\(foo\\))\n.\n<p><a href="(foo)">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nAny number of parentheses are allowed without escaping, as long as they are\nbalanced:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](foo(and(bar)))\n.\n<p><a href="foo(and(bar))">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\nHowever, if you have unbalanced parentheses, you need to escape or use the\n`<...>` form:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](foo\\(and\\(bar\\))\n.\n<p><a href="foo(and(bar)">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](<foo(and(bar)>)\n.\n<p><a href="foo(and(bar)">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nParentheses and other symbols can also be escaped, as usual\nin Markdown:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](foo\\)\\:)\n.\n<p><a href="foo):">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nA link can contain fragment identifiers and queries:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](#fragment)\n\n[link](http://example.com#fragment)\n\n[link](http://example.com?foo=3#frag)\n.\n<p><a href="#fragment">link</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://example.com#fragment">link</a></p>\n<p><a href="http://example.com?foo=3#frag">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nNote that a backslash before a non-escapable character is\njust a backslash:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](foo\\bar)\n.\n<p><a href="foo%5Cbar">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nURL-escaping should be left alone inside the destination, as all\nURL-escaped characters are also valid URL characters. Entity and\nnumerical character references in the destination will be parsed\ninto the corresponding Unicode code points, as usual.  These may\nbe optionally URL-escaped when written as HTML, but this spec\ndoes not enforce any particular policy for rendering URLs in\nHTML or other formats.

For example, it allows single-quoted\ntitles in inline links, but not reference links.  And, in\nreference links but not inline links, it allows a title to begin\nwith `"` and end with `)`.  `Markdown.pl` 1.0.1 even allows\ntitles with no closing quotation mark, though 1.0.2b8 does not.\nIt seems preferable to adopt a simple, rational rule that works\nthe same way in inline links and link reference definitions.)\n\n[Whitespace] is allowed around the destination and title:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link](   /uri\n  "title"  )\n.\n<p><a href="/uri" title="title">link</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nBut it is not allowed between the link text and the\nfollowing parenthesis:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link] (/uri)\n.\n<p>[link] (/uri)</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe link text may contain balanced brackets, but not unbalanced ones,\nunless they are escaped:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link [foo [bar]]](/uri)\n.\n<p><a href="/uri">link [foo [bar]]</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link] bar](/uri)\n.\n<p>[link] bar](/uri)</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link [bar](/uri)\n.\n<p>[link <a href="/uri">bar</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link \\[bar](/uri)\n.\n<p><a href="/uri">link [bar</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThe link text may contain inline content:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[link *foo **bar** `#`*](/uri)\n.\n<p><a href="/uri">link <em>foo <strong>bar</strong> <code>#</code></em></a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[![moon](moon.jpg)](/uri)\n.\n<p><a href="/uri"><img src="moon.jpg" alt="moon" /></a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nHowever, links may not contain other links, at any level of nesting.\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo [bar](/uri)](/uri)\n.\n<p>[foo <a href="/uri">bar</a>](/uri)</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo *[bar [baz](/uri)](/uri)*](/uri)\n.\n<p>[foo <em>[bar <a href="/uri">baz</a>](/uri)</em>](/uri)</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n![[[foo](uri1)](uri2)](uri3)\n.\n<p><img src="uri3" alt="[foo](uri2)" /></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThese cases illustrate the precedence of link text grouping over\nemphasis grouping:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n*[foo*](/uri)\n.\n<p>*<a href="/uri">foo*</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo *bar](baz*)\n.\n<p><a href="baz*">foo *bar</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nNote that brackets that *aren\'t* part of links do not take\nprecedence:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n*foo [bar* baz]\n.\n<p><em>foo [bar</em> baz]</p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThese cases illustrate the precedence of HTML tags, code spans,\nand autolinks over link grouping:\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo <bar attr="](baz)">\n.\n<p>[foo <bar attr="](baz)"></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo`](/uri)`\n.\n<p>[foo<code>](/uri)</code></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\n```````````````````````````````` example\n[foo<http://example.com/?search=](uri)>\n.\n<p>[foo<a href="http://example.com/?search=%5D(uri)">http://example.com/?search=](uri)</a></p>\n````````````````````````````````\n\n\nThere are three kinds of [reference link](@)s:\n[full](#full-reference-link), [collapsed](#collapsed-reference-link),\nand [shortcut](#shortcut-reference-link).\n\nA [full reference link](@)\nconsists of a [link text] immediately followed by a [link label]\nthat [matches] a [link reference definition] elsewhere in the document.\n\nA [link label](@)  begins with a left bracket (`[`) and ends\nwith the first right bracket (`]`) that is not backslash-escaped.\nBetween these brackets there must be at least one [non-whitespace character].\nUnescaped square bracket characters are not allowed inside the\nopening and closing square brackets of [link labels].  A link\nlabel can have at most 999 characters inside the square\nbrackets.\n\nOne label [matches](@)\nanother just in case their normalized forms are equal.  To normalize a\nlabel, strip off the opening and closing brackets,\nperform the *Unicode case fold*, strip leading and trailing\n[whitespace] and collapse consecutive internal\n[whitespace] to a single space.  If there are multiple\nmatching reference link definitions, the one that comes first in the\ndocument is used.

In the first phase, lines of input are consumed and the block\nstructure of the document---its division into paragraphs, block quotes,\nlist items, and so on---is constructed.  Text is assigned to these\nblocks but not parsed. Link reference definitions are parsed and a\nmap of links is constructed.\n\n2. In the second phase, the raw text contents of paragraphs and headings\nare parsed into sequences of Markdown inline elements (strings,\ncode spans, links, emphasis, and so on), using the map of link\nreferences constructed in phase 1.\n\nAt each point in processing, the document is represented as a tree of\n**blocks**.  The root of the tree is a `document` block.  The `document`\nmay have any number of other blocks as **children**.  These children\nmay, in turn, have other blocks as children.  The last child of a block\nis normally considered **open**, meaning that subsequent lines of input\ncan alter its contents.  (Blocks that are not open are **closed**.)\nHere, for example, is a possible document tree, with the open blocks\nmarked by arrows:\n\n``` tree\n-> document\n  -> block_quote\n       paragraph\n         "Lorem ipsum dolor\\nsit amet."\n    -> list (type=bullet tight=true bullet_char=-)\n         list_item\n           paragraph\n             "Qui *quodsi iracundia*"\n      -> list_item\n        -> paragraph\n             "aliquando id"\n```\n\n## Phase 1: block structure\n\nEach line that is processed has an effect on this tree.  The line is\nanalyzed and, depending on its contents, the document may be altered\nin one or more of the following ways:\n\n1. One or more open blocks may be closed.\n2. One or more new blocks may be created as children of the\n   last open block.\n3. Text may be added to the last (deepest) open block remaining\n   on the tree.\n\nOnce a line has been incorporated into the tree in this way,\nit can be discarded, so input can be read in a stream.\n\nFor each line, we follow this procedure:\n\n1. First we iterate through the open blocks, starting with the\nroot document, and descending through last children down to the last\nopen block.  Each block imposes a condition that the line must satisfy\nif the block is to remain open.  For example, a block quote requires a\n`>` character.  A paragraph requires a non-blank line.\nIn this phase we may match all or just some of the open\nblocks.  But we cannot close unmatched blocks yet, because we may have a\n[lazy continuation line].\n\n2.  Next, after consuming the continuation markers for existing\nblocks, we look for new block starts (e.g. `>` for a block quote).\nIf we encounter a new block start, we close any blocks unmatched\nin step 1 before creating the new block as a child of the last\nmatched block.\n\n3.  Finally, we look at the remainder of the line (after block\nmarkers like `>`, list markers, and indentation have been consumed).\nThis is text that can be incorporated into the last open\nblock (a paragraph, code block, heading, or raw HTML).\n\nSetext headings are formed when we see a line of a paragraph\nthat is a [setext heading underline].\n\nReference link definitions are detected when a paragraph is closed;\nthe accumulated text lines are parsed to see if they begin with\none or more reference link definitions.  Any remainder becomes a\nnormal paragraph.\n\nWe can see how this works by considering how the tree above is\ngenerated by four lines of Markdown:\n\n``` markdown\n> Lorem ipsum dolor\nsit amet.\n> - Qui *quodsi iracundia*\n> - aliquando id\n```\n\nAt the outset, our document model is just\n\n``` tree\n-> document\n```\n\nThe first line of our text,\n\n``` markdown\n> Lorem ipsum dolor\n```\n\ncauses a `block_quote` block to be created as a child of our\nopen `document` block, and a `paragraph` block as a child of\nthe `block_quote`.  Then the text is added to the last open\nblock, the `paragraph`:\n\n``` tree\n-> document\n  -> block_quote\n    -> paragraph\n         "Lorem ipsum dolor"\n```\n\nThe next line,\n\n``` markdown\nsit amet.\n```\n\nis a "lazy continuation" of the open `paragraph`, so it gets added\nto the paragraph\'s text:\n\n``` tree\n-> document\n  -> block_quote\n    -> paragraph\n         "Lorem ipsum dolor\\nsit amet."\n```\n\nThe third line,\n\n``` markdown\n> - Qui *quodsi iracundia*\n```\n\ncauses the `paragraph` block to be closed, and a new `list` block\nopened as a child of the `block_quote`.  A `list_item` is also\nadded as a child of the `list`, and a `paragraph` as a child of\nthe `list_item`.  The text is then added to the new `paragraph`:\n\n``` tree\n-> document\n  -> block_quote\n       paragraph\n         "Lorem ipsum dolor\\nsit amet."\n    -> list (type=bullet tight=true bullet_char=-)\n      -> list_item\n        -> paragraph\n             "Qui *quodsi iracundia*"\n```\n\nThe fourth line,\n\n``` markdown\n> - aliquando id\n```\n\ncauses the `list_item` (and its child the `paragraph`) to be closed,\nand a new `list_item` opened up as child of the `list`.  A `paragraph`\nis added as a child of the new `list_item`, to contain the text.\nWe thus obtain the final tree:\n\n``` tree\n-> document\n  -> block_quote\n       paragraph\n         "Lorem ipsum dolor\\nsit amet."\n    -> list (type=bullet tight=true bullet_char=-)\n         list_item\n           paragraph\n             "Qui *quodsi iracundia*"\n      -> list_item\n        -> paragraph\n             "aliquando id"\n```\n\n## Phase 2: inline structure\n\nOnce all of the input has been parsed, all open blocks are closed.\n\nWe then "walk the tree," visiting every node, and parse raw\nstring contents of paragraphs and headings as inlines.  At this\npoint we have seen all the link reference definitions, so we can\nresolve reference links as we go.\n\n``` tree\ndocument\n  block_quote\n    paragraph\n      str "Lorem ipsum dolor"\n      softbreak\n      str "sit amet."\n    list (type=bullet tight=true bullet_char=-)\n      list_item\n        paragraph\n          str "Qui "\n          emph\n            str "quodsi iracundia"\n      list_item\n        paragraph\n          str "aliquando id"\n```\n\nNotice how the [line ending] in the first paragraph has\nbeen parsed as a `softbreak`, and the asterisks in the first list item\nhave become an `emph`.\n\n### An algorithm for parsing nested emphasis and links\n\nBy far the trickiest part of inline parsing is handling emphasis,\nstrong emphasis, links, and images.  This is done using the following\nalgorithm.\n\nWhen we\'re parsing inlines and we hit either\n\n- a run of `*` or `_` characters, or\n- a `[` or `![`\n\nwe insert a text node with these symbols as its literal content, and we\nadd a pointer to this text node to the [delimiter stack](@).\n\nThe [delimiter stack] is a doubly linked list.  Each\nelement contains a pointer to a text node, plus information about\n\n- the type of delimiter (`[`, `![`, `*`, `_`)\n- the number of delimiters,\n- whether the delimiter is "active" (all are active to start), and\n- whether the delimiter is a potential opener, a potential closer,\n  or both (which depends on what sort of characters precede\n  and follow the delimiters).\n\nWhen we hit a `]` character, we call the *look for link or image*\nprocedure (see below).\n\nWhen we hit the end of the input, we call the *process emphasis*\nprocedure (see below), with `stack_bottom` = NULL.\n\n#### *look for link or image*\n\nStarting at the top of the delimiter stack, we look backwards\nthrough the stack for an opening `[` or `![` delimiter.\n\n- If we don\'t find one, we return a literal text node `]`.\n\n- If we do find one, but it\'s not *active*, we remove the inactive\n  delimiter from the stack, and return a literal text node `]`.\n\n- If we find one and it\'s active, then we parse ahead to see if\n  we have an inline link/image, reference link/image, compact reference\n  link/image, or shortcut reference link/image.\n\n  + If we don\'t, then we remove the opening delimiter from the\n    delimiter stack and return a literal text node `]`.\n\n  + If we do, then\n\n    * We return a link or image node whose children are the inlines\n      after the text node pointed to by the opening delimiter.\n\n    * We run *process emphasis* on these inlines, with the `[` opener\n      as `stack_bottom`.\n\n    * We remove the opening delimiter.\n\n    * If we have a link (and not an image), we also set all\n      `[` delimiters before the opening delimiter to *inactive*.  (This\n      will prevent us from getting links within links.)\n\n#### *process emphasis*\n\nParameter `stack_bottom` sets a lower bound to how far we\ndescend in the [delimiter stack].  If it is NULL, we can\ngo all the way to the bottom.  Otherwise, we stop before\nvisiting `stack_bottom`.\n\nLet `current_position` point to the element on the [delimiter stack]\njust above `stack_bottom` (or the first element if `stack_bottom`\nis NULL).\n\nWe keep track of the `openers_bottom` for each delimiter\ntype (`*`, `_`) and each length of the closing delimiter run\n(modulo 3).  Initialize this to `stack_bottom`.\n\nThen we repeat the following until we run out of potential\nclosers:\n\n- Move `current_position` forward in the delimiter stack (if needed)\n  until we find the first potential closer with delimiter `*` or `_`.\n  (This will be the potential closer closest\n  to the beginning of the input -- the first one in parse order.)\n\n- Now, look back in the stack (staying above `stack_bottom` and\n  the `openers_bottom` for this delimiter type) for the\n  first matching potential opener ("matching" means same delimiter).\n\n- If one is found:\n\n  + Figure out whether we have emphasis or strong emphasis:\n    if both closer and opener spans have length >= 2, we have\n    strong, otherwise regular.\n\n  + Insert an emph or strong emph node accordingly, after\n    the text node corresponding to the opener.\n\n  + Remove any delimiters between the opener and closer from\n    the delimiter stack.\n\n  + Remove 1 (for regular emph) or 2 (for strong emph) delimiters\n    from the opening and closing text nodes.  If they become empty\n    as a result, remove them and remove the corresponding element\n    of the delimiter stack.  If the closing node is removed, reset\n    `current_position` to the next element in the stack.\n\n- If none is found:\n\n  + Set `openers_bottom` to the element before `current_position`.\n    (We know that there are no openers for this kind of closer up to and\n    including this point, so this puts a lower bound on future searches.)\n\n  + If the closer at `current_position` is not a potential opener,\n    remove it from the delimiter stack (since we know it can\'t\n    be a closer either).\n\n  + Advance `current_position` to the next element in the stack.\n\nAfter we\'re done, we remove all delimiters above `stack_bottom` from the\ndelimiter stack.';export{n as default};
